# Hey! I'm Felipe!

Welcome to my slice of digital chaos, where programming meets a bunch of other things I love (and some I hate, but life's punches make us stronger).

## Who Am I and Why Should You Care?

I'm just a guy who loves clean code, a well-organized workbench full of electronic components and tools (or not), and hates a broken coffee machine. Just kidding—brewed coffee is always better.

Electronic Engineer, Master's student in AI, drummer in my spare time, and always in search of the perfect nonsense bar snack to pair with a good beer.

## "Education"

- **UTFPR:** Electronic Engineering and an ongoing Master's in AI.
  
## My Day Job

At **Pumatronix**, I work with computer vision, figuring out what license plates are trying to tell us and counting vehicles on public roads.

## My Digital Frankensteins

Here are some of my projects, my little monsters built through sleepless nights and countless cups of coffee:

- **[Piu Piu Annihilator](https://github.com/felipedepauli/piu-piu-annihilator):** The coolest (and only slightly dangerous) toy gun you'll see today.
- **[Sentinel Eyes](https://github.com/felipedepauli/sentinel-eyes):** A drone that recognizes your face and judges your fashion choices. No... it just recognizes your face. It won’t even notice that moth-eaten shirt.
- **[Tattoo Tracer](https://github.com/felipedepauli/tattoo_trace):** Who needs an ID when you have a tattoo? This system detects people, tattoos, and poses and magically guesses where the tattoo is on your body. If you're on the run from the police and have an ex’s name tattooed, you’d better hide those beauties.

## Contact

Want to talk to me? You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-camargo-de-pauli/) or retweeting unnecessary things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/afabrica). If you prefer good old email, send me your chain letters and memes at [felipe@aincrivelfabrica.com.br](mailto:felipe@aincrivelfabrica.com.br?subject=Hey%20Felipe).

## What's Coming Next...

I’m planning to make Piu Piu and Sentinel Eyes autonomous using AI because what the world clearly needs is more autonomous machines with destructive potential. Sorry if I’m helping humanity tread its path toward extinction.

Challenges to do! I want to complete Kaggle Challenges to revisit all possible concepts of Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

### 1. Data Analysis
- [OK] Titanic Analysis: Explore and analyze the Titanic dataset to understand the factors influencing passenger survival.
- [OK] Spaceship: 
  [OK] KDD Cup 2009
### 2. Machine Learning
- House Price Prediction: Develop a model to predict house prices based on various characteristics.
- Credit Card Fraud Detection: Build a model to identify fraudulent transactions in a credit card transaction dataset.

### 3. Deep Learning
- Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST): Use neural networks to recognize handwritten digits.
- Dog Breed Classification: Implement a deep learning model to classify dog breeds from images.

### 4. Computer Vision
- Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Rays: Develop a computer vision model to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images.
- Cell Nucleus Image Segmentation: Create a model to segment cell nuclei in microscope images.

### 5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Sentiment Analysis of Tweets: Analyze the sentiment of tweets related to natural disasters.
- Automatic Text Summarization: Develop an NLP model to generate automatic summaries of long texts.

### 6. Reinforcement Learning
- Atari Game Agent Training: Use reinforcement learning techniques to train an agent to play a classic Atari game.

# Portfolio
